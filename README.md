# Ishaara Ai : The Indian Sign Language Translator For the Indian Deaf And Mute

Over 63 million people in India, or about 6.3% of the population, are hard of hearing. This group is expected to grow due to factors such as aging. Though they do not regard their hearing loss as a disability, but rather a different way of life, their social interactions can be significantly limited.

To prevent isolation within the often exclusive deaf community, we, the students of [MH Saboo Siddik College of Engineering](https://www.mhssce.ac.in/), affiliated with the [University of Mumbaiâ€™s](https://mu.ac.in/) Computer Engineering Department, took the challenge to bridge this communication gap using machine learning and computer vision techniques.

Our project focuses on creating a robust, scalable system to predict, interpret, and translate Indian Sign Language (ISL) in real-time, without requiring specialized hardware. ISL combines actions, facial expressions, and body language, differing from other sign languages like American Sign Language (ASL), which may use single-hand gestures; ISL usually uses both hands. This complexity presents challenges in developing an accurate machine learning model for ISL interpretation.

For our third-year Mini Project, we began our research with a visit to the [Bombay Institution For Deaf & Mutes](https://www.justdial.com/Mumbai/Bombay-Institute-For-The-Deaf-Mutes-Opposite-Mazgaon-Court-Mazgaon/022P860275_BZDET). We initially gathered information about commonly used actions and words through the institution's teachers

### Object Detection Based Ishaara Model
* Collected Images with static actions.
* Labelled them using Roboflow and LabelImg
* Trained model on cloud using roboflow.
* Run it locally without any external installation.
   - Click [here](https://github.com/vnrr2023/ishaara_ml/blob/main/RCNN%2Broboflow/sampleApp%20(1).zip) to get the ```Zip``` Folder.
   - click the ```download``` icon.
   - Extract the folder and open ```isl-actions-v4```.
   - Run the ``` index.html``` file and start Signing.
* Metrics

###  GRU Based Sequence To Sequence Model using Mediapipe Version 2
![Gru](https://github.com/vnrr2023/ishaara_ml/blob/main/GIFS/rnn.gif?raw=true)
- Extracted landmarks using Mediapipe from videos collected from school students.
- Works with 99% testing accuracy with 6 actions namely 
  + blank (no action)
  + hello
  + how are you
  + sorry
  + welcome
  + thank you
- Also consists of ready model and depth detection model to automate the users process of signing.
- For sentence creation ChatGPT was used.
- For trying Out 
  + Intall python 3.11
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  git clone https://github.com/vnrr2023/ishaara_ml/tree/main
  cd "GRU+Mediapipe"
  cd "Version_2"
  py main.py
 
```

### GRU Based Sequence To Sequence Model using Mediapipe Version 2.5
- Collected more data  for 20 labels.
- Could not be developed because some actions have similar initial poses.
- Difficulty in classifying hello and morning,sorry and time,etc.
- Data will be available soon....
